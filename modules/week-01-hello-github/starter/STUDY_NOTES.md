# Week 1: Hello, GitHub - Study Notes

**Elyana Bekele**

## Development Environment Setup

**Software installed and versions:**
[List each piece of software you installed: .NET SDK, Visual Studio Code, Git, and any VS Code extensions]

Answer: .NET SDK, Visual Studio Code, Git

**Operating system:**
[What OS are you using? Windows, macOS, or Linux?]

Answer: macOS

## Challenges and Solutions

**Biggest challenge during setup:**
[What was the hardest part? Installing software, configuring VS Code, understanding the terminal, or something else?]

Answer:The hardest part was setting up my Git repository on my soaftware.

**How you solved it:**
[Explain what you did to overcome the challenge - search online, ask for help, restart your computer, etc.]

Answer: Honestly, I searched the internet heavily and tried to understand what's going on. It's still very confusing, but I tried my best to understand and get my code to work.

**Most confusing concept:**
[What was hardest to understand? Git commands, terminal navigation, C# syntax, or dotnet CLI?]

Answer: The hardest to understand, more than anything is the Git commands and anything related to Git.

## Understanding C# Basics

**What does `Console.WriteLine()` do?**
[Explain in your own words what this command does]

Answer: Prints an output of the given input displayed in the parantheses.

**What is the purpose of `Program.cs`?**
[Why is this file important in a C# project?]

Answer: This is where you write your codes.

**What does `dotnet run` do?**
[Explain what happens when you run this command]

Answer: It runs your code and give the output.

## Git Workflow Understanding

**What is the difference between `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push`?**
[Explain each command and when you would use it]

Answer: Git add is when git traks the changes you made, and git commit is when its "saving a snapshot" of your work that made changes on, lastly git push is when git sends your work to another repository like github, you use this when you want to share your code with others/class.

**Why do we create branches?**
[Explain the purpose of creating a student branch]

Answer: The reason why we create a student branch is so it can allows us to work separately on our assignments and make any changes without affecting the main project itself.

## What I Learned

**Key takeaways from this week:**
[What are the 3 most important things you learned?]

1. The process of learning how Git and GitHub work (I still want to learn more and get more familiar with them).
2. Using .Net to run my projects, getting familiar with the terminal, and using learning to use dotnet run.
3. Learning about branches. This was the first time I leared about branches, and it was interesting to see how we need to branch our codes.

**How this connects to professional development:**
[Why are these skills important for programmers?]

Answer: These skills are important to learn as a programmer because they help you work well with others, manage your codes and gives you space to test the efficiency of your programs.

## Time Spent

**Total time:** [9 hours]

**Breakdown:**

-   Installing and configuring software: [1 hours]
-   Learning terminal/command line basics: [2 hours]
-   Writing the "Hello, GitHub!" program: [2 hours]
-   Understanding Git workflow: [1 hours]
-   Testing and fixing issues: [2 hours]
-   Writing documentation: [1 hours]

**Most time-consuming part:** [Which aspect took the longest and why?]

Answer: Three parts took the longest for me. First, learning the terminal and the Git commands, because it was all new to me. Second, the “Hello, GitHub!” project took a while because I initially put my code in the starter folder, but dotnet run wouldn’t give me the output since I wasn’t in the folder containing the .csproj file. My file also wasn’t connected correctly at first, which added to the delay. Lastly, testing and fixing took time as well. I also had trouble connecting my repository to my software using the terminal because GitHub no longer allows password authentication for HTTPS cloning. I had to create an SSH key and use that method instead, which finally let me clone and push my code successfully.
