# Week 1: Hello, GitHub - Study Notes

**Name:** Katherine Ayala Reyes

## Development Environment Setup

**Software installed and versions:**
[List each piece of software you installed: .NET SDK, Visual Studio Code, Git, and any VS Code extensions]

Answer:
.NET SDK: 9.0.308,

Visual Studio Code: 1.108.0, Git: 2.52.0.windows.1,

VS Code extensions: C# Dev Kit, C#, EditorConfig for VS Code


**Operating system:**

Answer: Windows 11

## Challenges and Solutions

**Biggest challenge during setup:**
[What was the hardest part? Installing software, configuring VS Code, understanding the terminal, or something else?]

Answer: I feel like the biggest challenge was understanding how the terminal works and making sure I was in the correct folder when running commands like dotnet run and dotnet test

**How you solved it:**
[Explain what you did to overcome the challenge - search online, ask for help, restart your computer, etc.]

Answer:  I reopened VS Code with the correct folder, used cd to navigate properly, and learned to open the terminal directly in the correct folder using “Open in Integrated Terminal.”

**Most confusing concept:**
[What was hardest to understand? Git commands, terminal navigation, C# syntax, or dotnet CLI?]

Answer:  Terminal navigation and understanding that commands only work when run from the correct directory containing the project files.

## Understanding C# Basics

**What does `Console.WriteLine()` do?**
[Explain in your own words what this command does]

Answer: Console.writeline() prints text to the terminal

**What is the purpose of `Program.cs`?**
[Why is this file important in a C# project?]

Answer:

**What does `dotnet run` do?**
[Explain what happens when you run this command]

Answer: dotnet run builds and runs the program in the terminal

## Git Workflow Understanding

**What is the difference between `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push`?**
[Explain each command and when you would use it]

Answer:  git add selects the files we want to include, git commit takes what we added or included and saves our changes with a message, git push uploads our saved work to github. We would use this when turning in homework.

**Why do we create branches?**
Answer: We create branches to keep assignment work separate from the main code

## What I Learned

**Key takeaways from this week:**
[What are the 3 most important things you learned?]

1. How to run a C# program using dotnet run
2. How to navigate folders and use the terminal correctly.
3. How to print words to the console using Console.WriteLine()

**How this connects to professional development:**
[Why are these skills important for programmers?]

Answer:These skills are important for programmers because tools like Github and terminals are used in real world jobs to manage and test codes.

## Time Spent

**Total time:** 3 hours, 35 min

**Breakdown:**

-   Installing and configuring software: 1 hours
-   Learning terminal/command line basics: 1 hours
-   Writing the "Hello, GitHub!" program: 15 min
-   Understanding Git workflow: 30 min
-   Testing and fixing issues: 20 min
-   Writing documentation: 30 min

**Most time-consuming part:** [Which aspect took the longest and why?]

Answer: Learning terminal navigation and fixing errors when commands were run from the wrong folder were the most time consuming because I was still getting used to how directories work and where commands need to be run.
