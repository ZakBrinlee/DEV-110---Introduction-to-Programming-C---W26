# Week 1: Hello, GitHub - Study Notes

**Name:**

## Development Environment Setup

**Software installed and versions:**
[List each piece of software you installed: .NET SDK, Visual Studio Code, Git, and any VS Code extensions]

Answer: .NET 9.0.0, Visual Studio Codes, GIT, C# Dev Kit, C#, EditorConfig for VS Code

**Operating system:**
[What OS are you using? Windows, macOS, or Linux?]

Answer: Windows

## Challenges and Solutions

**Biggest challenge during setup:**
[What was the hardest part? Installing software, configuring VS Code, understanding the terminal, or something else?]

Answer: Figuring out how to use github, having no real experience with it

**How you solved it:**
[Explain what you did to overcome the challenge - search online, ask for help, restart your computer, etc.]

Answer: I had to ask my brother about github

**Most confusing concept:**
[What was hardest to understand? Git commands, terminal navigation, C# syntax, or dotnet CLI?]

Answer: Git commands

## Understanding C# Basics

**What does `Console.WriteLine()` do?**
[Explain in your own words what this command does]

Answer: It puts the data in the line into the console and puts the cursor after it

**What is the purpose of `Program.cs`?**
[Why is this file important in a C# project?]

Answer: I think it's like the main file, where all the executables live?

**What does `dotnet run` do?**
[Explain what happens when you run this command]

Answer: It runs the .NET application from the source code

## Git Workflow Understanding

**What is the difference between `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push`?**
[Explain each command and when you would use it]

Answer: git add puts the file into a list where you can organize and choose what to commit. git commit puts what you want into a queue, a train cargo, and prepares it for transport. git push is pushing that train into the train station, where it is stored and able to be shared to everyone.

**Why do we create branches?**
[Explain the purpose of creating a student branch]

Answer: So we don't modify the base file, we create a seperate version to work on individually

## What I Learned

**Key takeaways from this week:**
[What are the 3 most important things you learned?]

1. Git is confusing
2. C# is pretty similar to java
3. I learned how to use the terminal (powershell)

**How this connects to professional development:**
[Why are these skills important for programmers?]

Answer: I think most all programmers use git now. Learning how to learn different coding languages is a skill on its own, knowing the differences between them.

## Time Spent

**Total time:** [2 hours]

**Breakdown:**

-   Installing and configuring software: [1.5 hours]
-   Learning terminal/command line basics: [0.1 hours]
-   Writing the "Hello, GitHub!" program: [0.1 hours]
-   Understanding Git workflow: [0.1 hours]
-   Testing and fixing issues: [0 hours]
-   Writing documentation: [0.2 hours]

**Most time-consuming part:** [Which aspect took the longest and why?]

Answer: Installing the software. Follwing the guide didn't work for me, so I needed to find someone to understood git and forking and such to help.
