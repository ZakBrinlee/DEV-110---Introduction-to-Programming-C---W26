# Week 1: Hello, GitHub - Study Notes

**Name:**
Rin Peralez

## Development Environment Setup

**Software installed and versions:**
[List each piece of software you installed: .NET SDK, Visual Studio Code, Git, and any VS Code extensions]

Answer: .NET SDK, Git (Brew was out of date), Better Comments, indent-rainbow, Markdown All in One, Editor Config

**Operating system:**
[What OS are you using? Windows, macOS, or Linux?]

Answer: macOS

## Challenges and Solutions

**Biggest challenge during setup:**
[What was the hardest part? Installing software, configuring VS Code, understanding the terminal, or something else?]

Answer: My Mac kept using MacOS standard Git which was out-of-date so I had spent 30 minutes debugging that and switching to proper brew version.

**How you solved it:**
[Explain what you did to overcome the challenge - search online, ask for help, restart your computer, etc.]

Answer: (I searched it online and then asked my boyfriend if he had switched over Git on my computer when I got a new one, and then asked Gemini what it could possibly be after it was still showing the issue when it was updated and said it was the most up to date version.)

**Most confusing concept:**
[What was hardest to understand? Git commands, terminal navigation, C# syntax, or dotnet CLI?]

Answer: C# is actually very similar to Java so it was easy, the worst was the Repository Nav, theres a lot of errors and typos that made it difficult because what I thought was right was not what was on the repo. It made setup pretty confusing.

## Understanding C# Basics

**What does `Console.WriteLine()` do?**
[Explain in your own words what this command does]

Answer: It writes out the given input out onto the console.

**What is the purpose of `Program.cs`?**
[Why is this file important in a C# project?]

Answer: Its the file that runs the code.

**What does `dotnet run` do?**
[Explain what happens when you run this command]

Answer: It runs the program and compiles the code

## Git Workflow Understanding

**What is the difference between `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push`?**
[Explain each command and when you would use it]

Answer: git add accepts code you want to commit, git commit keeps your added code in local memory, and git push sends all your committed code to the repository.

**Why do we create branches?**
[Explain the purpose of creating a student branch]

Answer: We create branches to work on a project without messing with/up the pre-functioning code, and allow ourselves to make mistakes and bugs that dont detriment the entire project.

## What I Learned

**Key takeaways from this week:**
[What are the 3 most important things you learned?]

1. Make sure git versions are up to date, unlike the first time
2. CSharp is very similar to Java very similar structure different commands
3. Documentation sucks and this program isnt registering my changes

**How this connects to professional development:**
[Why are these skills important for programmers?]

Answer: without being able to understand git, your code and changes could be to the detriment of the entire project and cause severe/unreversable mistakes, causing your team to be forced to work more and spend more time than needed.
