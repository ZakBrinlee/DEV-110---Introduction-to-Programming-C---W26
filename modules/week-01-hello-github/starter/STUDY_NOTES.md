## Challenges and Solutions

**Biggest challenge during setup:**

[Explain what happens when you run this command]

Answer: VS Code gives me an error :)

Couldn't find a project to run. Ensure a project exists in /Users/EpicE/Desktop/Dev110/DEV-110---Introduction-to-Programming-C---W26-main, or pass the path to the project using --project.

## Git Workflow Understanding
