# Week 1: Hello, GitHub - Study Notes

**Name:**
Mateo Minor

## Development Environment Setup

**Software installed and versions:**
[List each piece of software you installed: .NET SDK, Visual Studio Code, Git, and any VS Code extensions]

Answer: I installed visual studio code, C# dev kit, C# for vscode, Editorconfig, Git, and NET 9.0 SDK.

**Operating system:**
[What OS are you using? Windows, macOS, or Linux?]

Answer: Windows

## Challenges and Solutions

**Biggest challenge during setup:**
[What was the hardest part? Installing software, configuring VS Code, understanding the terminal, or something else?]

Answer: Setting up the Github repo was defintely a large challenge. It is still going to be tricky.

**How you solved it:**
[Explain what you did to overcome the challenge - search online, ask for help, restart your computer, etc.]

Answer: I went to study hall to get help through the process of setting up the Github.

**Most confusing concept:**
[What was hardest to understand? Git commands, terminal navigation, C# syntax, or dotnet CLI?]

Answer: It is very hard to understand how repo and VScode integrate together. It makes sense but is so complicated.

## Understanding C# Basics

**What does `Console.WriteLine()` do?**
[Explain in your own words what this command does]

Answer: This command once run displays whatever text you write within the parethesis to the console.

**What is the purpose of `Program.cs`?**
[Why is this file important in a C# project?]

Answer: The file is important because it is C# code!

**What does `dotnet run` do?**
[Explain what happens when you run this command]

Answer: This command runs the C# code that we have written.

## Git Workflow Understanding

**What is the difference between `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push`?**
[Explain each command and when you would use it]

Answer: Git add makes the changes you made to the given file "staged". basically telling it to look at this file.
Git commit locally saves all of the files that you have added to "staged". Git push saves them to the online repo.

**Why do we create branches?**
[Explain the purpose of creating a student branch]

Answer: As I understand it, branches let you work on a clone of a part of your project that you can merge with the
complete repo when you complete it. This gives you the freedom to make mistakes and try new things without having to
worry about messing up anything.

## What I Learned

**Key takeaways from this week:**
[What are the 3 most important things you learned?]

1. How Github works and a basic idea of how to use it.
2. Some C# syntax.
3. To make sure to attent study hall or post to the group discussion if I need help!

**How this connects to professional development:**
[Why are these skills important for programmers?]

Answer: Github is widely used and understanding how programmers collaborate and share code is very important. Being
able to ask for help is also a major part of working as a team and growing as a programmer.

## Time Spent

**Total time:** [3.5 hours]

**Breakdown:**

-   Installing and configuring software: [3.4 hours]
-   Learning terminal/command line basics: [.1 hours]
-   Writing the "Hello, GitHub!" program: [.1 hours]
-   Understanding Git workflow: [1 hours]
-   Testing and fixing issues: [.1 hours]
-   Writing documentation: [.1 hours]

**Most time-consuming part:** [Which aspect took the longest and why?]

Answer: Configuring github took the longest by far. There is a lot of setup required to get it integrated with the
website and my computer. Not having done this before I found it quite challenging and I did a lot of trouble shooting
but I had no luck. Luckily study hall was able to help me resolve all of my issues and more.
