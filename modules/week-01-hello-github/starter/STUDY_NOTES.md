# Week 1: Hello, GitHub - Study Notes

**Name:Andrew Anderson**

## Development Environment Setup

**Software installed and versions:**
[List each piece of software you installed: .NET SDK, Visual Studio Code, Git, and any VS Code extensions]

Answer: I installed the main software as instructed, including the .NET SDK, Visual Studio Code, and Git.
For VS Code extensions, I have installed the .NET Install Tool, Better Comments, C#, C# Dev Kit, EditorConfig for VS,
indent-rainbow, and Markdown All in One.

**Operating system:**
[What OS are you using? Windows, macOS, or Linux?]

Answer: Windows 11

## Challenges and Solutions

**Biggest challenge during setup:**
[What was the hardest part? Installing software, configuring VS Code, understanding the terminal, or something else?]

Answer: The most challenging aspect was grasping the terminal and integrating it to run my code,
as I had no previous experience with it.

**How you solved it:**
[Explain what you did to overcome the challenge - search online, ask for help, restart your computer, etc.]

Answer: The way I overcame this challenge was by searching online for the exact issue,
and I successfully found a solution that worked perfectly.

**Most confusing concept:**
[What was hardest to understand? Git commands, terminal navigation, C# syntax, or dotnet CLI?]

Answer: The most challenging concept for me to grasp was terminal navigation, as I don't have much experience
using terminals. As I attempted to figure it out on my own, I became overwhelmed because I was making little
progress in getting it to work.

## Understanding C# Basics

**What does `Console.WriteLine()` do?**
[Explain in your own words what this command does]

Answer: The Console.WriteLine() method outputs the inserted value in the parenthesis to the console and adds
a new line afterward.

**What is the purpose of `Program.cs`?**
[Why is this file important in a C# project?]

Answer: The Program.cs file is crucial as it contains the main C# code, which is easy to read.
This file outlines how a C# program functions, helping to keep things organized and ensuring
everything compiles correctly.

**What does `dotnet run` do?**
[Explain what happens when you run this command]

Answer: The dotnet run command is a handy way to quickly build and run your .NET app straight from the source
code using the command line. It’s great for a smooth and quick development process.

## Git Workflow Understanding

**What is the difference between `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push`?**
[Explain each command and when you would use it]

Answer: `git add` takes a modified file in your working directory and places the modified version in a staging area.
You would use `git add` after modifying and saving one or more files.
`git commit` takes everything from the staging area and makes a permanent snapshot of the current state of your
repository that is associated with a unique identifier. You should use `git commit` whenever you reach a stable and
logically complete stage of work that you want to save. Committing frequently acts as a safety point, allowing you
to easily revert to a previous working state just in case something goes wrong.
`git push` uploads local commits from your local repository to a specified remote repository like GitHub. You should
use `git push` when you are ready to upload your local repository to GitHub. This way, you will have a remote backup
of your work and can collaborate with others.

**Why do we create branches?**
[Explain the purpose of creating a student branch]

Answer: Branches are primarily used to isolate development work, allowing developers to work on new features or bug
fixes in parallel without affecting the stability of the main codebase. This prevents broken or unstable code from
reaching the production version of the software.

## What I Learned

**Key takeaways from this week:**
[What are the 3 most important things you learned?]

1. One thing that I've learned is how to properly install all the necessary software and additional extensions for VS Code as instructed.
2. Another thing I've learned is a couple of basic C# concepts and their applications, such as using Console.WriteLine() to display text in a terminal, running applications with dotnet run in an integrated terminal, and the significance of the Program.cs file.
3. The last thing that I've learned is the Git Workflow, along with the different areas of Git that demostrate how the commands git add, git commit, and git push allows the user to navigate through each area of the Git Workflow effectively.

**How this connects to professional development:**
[Why are these skills important for programmers?]

Answer: These skills are essential for programmers as they lay the groundwork and provide the necessary tools for
effective, collaborative, and professional software development.

## Time Spent

**Total time:** 9 hours

**Breakdown:**

-   Installing and configuring software: [1 hour]
-   Learning terminal/command line basics: [2 hours]
-   Writing the "Hello, GitHub!" program: [1 hour]
-   Understanding Git workflow: [1.5 hours]
-   Testing and fixing issues: [.5 hour]
-   Writing documentation: [3 hour]

**Most time-consuming part:** [Which aspect took the longest and why?]

Answer: Writing the documentation took the longest time because I needed to research the definitions and meanings
of various C# fundamentals. Additionally, I aimed to gain a thorough understanding of how the Git workflow functions
to prepare myself for future assignments in this course.
