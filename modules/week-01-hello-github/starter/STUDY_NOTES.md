# Week 1: Hello, GitHub - Study Notes

**Name:**

## Development Environment Setup

**Software installed and versions:**
[List each piece of software you installed: .NET SDK, Visual Studio Code, Git, and any VS Code extensions]

Answer: .NET SDK 9 & 10; VS Code; Git, all recomended extensions

**Operating system:**
[What OS are you using? Windows, macOS, or Linux?]

Answer: Windows

## Challenges and Solutions

**Biggest challenge during setup:**
[What was the hardest part? Installing software, configuring VS Code, understanding the terminal, or something else?]

Answer: understanding that I needed to make sure I had downloaded the same .NET SDK as the one that our assignments use and not just the most current

**How you solved it:**
[Explain what you did to overcome the challenge - search online, ask for help, restart your computer, etc.]

Answer: I noticed the versions were different and downloaded the correct version

**Most confusing concept:**
[What was hardest to understand? Git commands, terminal navigation, C# syntax, or dotnet CLI?]

Answer: all fairly simple for this assignment as I have worked a little with all but C# and dotnet CLI; I did have some confusion when initially cloning the respository because the name in the copied code is not the same as the repository name you need to use

## Understanding C# Basics

**What does `Console.WriteLine()` do?**
[Explain in your own words what this command does]

Answer: it displays that lines output to the terminal/screen

**What is the purpose of `Program.cs`?**
[Why is this file important in a C# project?]

Answer: this is where your main code is located; without it no program

**What does `dotnet run` do?**
[Explain what happens when you run this command]

Answer: it executes the code

## Git Workflow Understanding

**What is the difference between `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push`?**
[Explain each command and when you would use it]

Answer:add - adds your files to a 'staging/waiting' area; commit saves it to your local repository; push saves it to your remote repository (in our case here on github)

**Why do we create branches?**
[Explain the purpose of creating a student branch]

Answer: it allows many people to work on their own copy of the same main project without messing up the original project; then they can send their work to be reviewed and incorporated into the original main project

## What I Learned

**Key takeaways from this week:**
[What are the 3 most important things you learned?]

1. check your versions
2. following standards (in code, naming, etc) is key for readable, sustainable code
3. extensions help a lot

**How this connects to professional development:**
[Why are these skills important for programmers?]

Answer: in order to produce good work one must have a good work space

## Time Spent

**Total time:** 2.5 hours

**Breakdown:**

-   Installing and configuring software: [.5 hours]
-   Learning terminal/command line basics: [.25 hours]
-   Writing the "Hello, GitHub!" program: [.25 hours]
-   Understanding Git workflow: [.25 hours]
-   Testing and fixing issues: [.1 hours]
-   Writing documentation: [.25 hours]

**Most time-consuming part:** [Which aspect took the longest and why?]

Answer: testing/fixing issues cause I couldn't figure out why tests wouldn't run and why vs code couldn't find the respsitory since we were told to change our name but the respository name was Also different
